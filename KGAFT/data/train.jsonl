{"question":"Describe the difference between the order and degree of a differential equation, and explain when the degree is not defined.","answer":"The order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative present in the equation. For example, the equation d²y/dx² + 3dy/dx + 2y = 0 has order 2 because the highest derivative is the second derivative. The degree of a differential equation is defined only if the equation is a polynomial in its derivatives, and it's the highest power of the highest order derivative. For example, the equation (d²y/dx²)² + (dy/dx)³ + y = 0 has degree 2 because the highest order derivative (second derivative) is raised to the power of 2. However, the degree is not defined when the equation is not a polynomial in its derivatives, such as in the equation dy/dx + sin(dy/dx) = 0, where the sine function makes it non-polynomial.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct as it accurately reflects the definitions provided in the source material.

The source further explains that 'equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in y' and 'the degree of differential equation (11) is not defined.'"}
{"question":"Explain the concept of general and particular solutions of differential equations, and provide examples to illustrate the difference.","answer":"A general solution of a differential equation is a solution that contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the differential equation. It represents the entire family of possible solutions. For example, the general solution of the differential equation d²y/dx² + y = 0 is y = a sin(x + b), where a and b are arbitrary constants. A particular solution is obtained from the general solution by assigning specific values to the arbitrary constants, often based on initial or boundary conditions. For instance, if we set a = 2 and b = π/4 in the general solution, we get the particular solution y = 2 sin(x + π/4). The general solution contains all possible solutions, while the particular solution satisfies specific conditions and represents one specific curve from the family of solutions.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct as it accurately reflects the definitions provided in the source material.

The source also provides examples such as y = a sin(x + b) as the general solution and y = 2 sin(x + π/4) as a particular solution."}
{"question":"Explain the method of solving homogeneous differential equations, including the substitution used and how it transforms the equation.","answer":"A homogeneous differential equation is one where F(x, y) in dy/dx = F(x, y) is a homogeneous function of degree zero. To solve such equations, we use the substitution y = vx, where v is a function of x. This substitution works because a homogeneous function of degree zero can be expressed as a function of y/x. After substituting y = vx, we get dy/dx = v + x dv/dx. Substituting this into the differential equation transforms it into an equation in terms of v and x that can be solved by separating variables. For example, to solve the equation (x - y)dy/dx = x + 2y, we first rewrite it as dy/dx = (x + 2y)/(x - y). Then we substitute y = vx, so dy/dx = v + x dv/dx, leading to v + x dv/dx = (1 + 2v)/(1 - v). This simplifies to x dv/dx = (1 + 2v)/(1 - v) - v = (v² + v + 1)/(1 - v), which can be separated into (v - 1)/(v² + v + 1) dv = -dx/x and integrated to find the solution.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct as it accurately describes the method for solving homogeneous differential equations as explained in the source material. The source states: 'A differential equation of the form dy/dx = F(x, y) is said to be homogenous if F(x, y) is a homogenous function of degree zero.' It then explains the substitution method: 'To solve a homogeneous differential equation of the type dy/dx = F(x, y) = g(y/x) We make the substitution y = vx.'

{"question":"Describe the process of solving a first-order linear differential equation using the integrating factor method, including the formula for the integrating factor and how it transforms the equation.","answer":"To solve a first-order linear differential equation of the form dy/dx + Py = Q, where P and Q are constants or functions of x only, we use the integrating factor method. The integrating factor (I.F.) is calculated as e^(∫P dx). Multiplying the entire differential equation by the I.F. transforms the left-hand side into the derivative of the product of the dependent variable and the I.F. For example, for the equation dy/dx + y = sin x, P = 1 and Q = sin x. The I.F. = e^(∫1 dx) = e^x. Multiplying both sides by e^x gives e^x dy/dx + e^x y = e^x sin x, which simplifies to d/dx(ye^x) = e^x sin x. Integrating both sides yields ye^x = ∫e^x sin x dx + C, which can be solved using integration by parts to find y = (1/2)sin x - (1/2)cos x + Ce^(-x).

{"question":"How does one determine the order and degree of a differential equation? Explain the conditions under which the degree is defined.","answer":"The order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative present in the equation. For example, in the equation dy/dx = e^x, the highest order derivative is the first derivative, so the order is 1. The degree of a differential equation is defined only if the equation is a polynomial equation in its derivatives. It is the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order derivative. For example, in the equation (d^3y/dx^3) + 2(d^2y/dx^2)^2 - dy/dx + y = 0, the degree is 1 because the highest order derivative (d^3y/dx^3) has power 1. The degree is not defined for equations like (dy/dx) + sin(dy/dx) = 0 because it's not a polynomial equation in its derivatives.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct as it directly reflects the definitions provided in the source material.

{"question":"What is the difference between a general solution and a particular solution of a differential equation? How does this relate to the number of arbitrary constants?","answer":"A general solution of a differential equation is a solution that contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the differential equation. For example, for a second-order differential equation, the general solution will contain two arbitrary constants. A particular solution, on the other hand, is obtained from the general solution by assigning specific values to these arbitrary constants. The particular solution does not contain any arbitrary constants. The source material states: 'The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution (primitive) of the differential equation. The solution free from arbitrary constants i.e., the solution obtained from the general solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular solution of the differential equation.'","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct as it directly reflects the definitions provided in the source material.

{"question":"Explain the method of solving a first-order differential equation using the separation of variables. What are the conditions that must be satisfied for this method to be applicable?","answer":"The method of separation of variables is applicable when a differential equation can be written in the form dy/dx = g(x)h(y), where g(x) is a function of x only and h(y) is a function of y only. The equation is then rearranged as (1/h(y)) dy = g(x) dx. Both sides can then be integrated to find the solution. As stated in the source material: 'If F(x, y) can be expressed as a product g(x)h(y), where, g(x) is a function of x and h(y) is a function of y, then the differential equation (1) is said to be of variable separable type.

{"question":"What is an integrating factor and how is it used to solve first-order linear differential equations? Explain with an example.","answer":"An integrating factor (I.F.) is a function that, when multiplied by a linear differential equation, transforms the left-hand side into the derivative of a product. For a first-order linear differential equation of the form dy/dx + Py = Q, where P and Q are functions of x only, the integrating factor is e^(∫P dx). Multiplying the equation by this integrating factor makes the left-hand side equal to d/dx(y * I.F.). The solution is then given by y * I.F. = ∫(Q * I.F.) dx + C. For example, in the equation dy/dx + y = sin x, P = 1 and Q = sin x. The integrating factor is e^(∫1 dx) = e^x. Multiplying the equation by e^x gives d/dx(ye^x) = e^x sin x. Integrating both sides gives ye^x = ∫e^x sin x dx + C.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct as it directly reflects the method of using integrating factors as described in the source material.

{"question":"Explain why the degree of the differential equation dy/dx + sin(dy/dx) = 0 cannot be defined, and connect this to the source material's definition of degree for differential equations.","answer":"The degree cannot be defined because the equation is not a polynomial equation in its derivatives. According to the source material, the degree of a differential equation is only defined when it is a polynomial equation in the derivatives (e.g., y', y''). In this case, the term sin(dy/dx) is a transcendental function of the derivative, violating the polynomial requirement. The source explicitly states that equations like dy/dx + sin(dy/dx) = 0 cannot have a defined degree, as seen in Example 11 where similar equations are discussed.","answer_reasoning":"This answer correctly identifies the requirement for degree definition (polynomial in derivatives) as stated in Section 9.2.2 of the source. The source specifies that degree is only defined for polynomial equations in derivatives, and sin(dy/dx) makes the equation non-polynomial, rendering degree undefined. This aligns with the source's example (equation 11) where degree is not defined for non-polynomial derivative equations."}

{"question":"Explain the role of the substitution y = vx in solving homogeneous differential equations, and justify why this substitution is effective based on the source material.","answer":"The substitution y = vx transforms a homogeneous differential equation into a separable equation by leveraging the homogeneity property. Since a homogeneous function F(x,y) satisfies F(λx, λy) = λ^n F(x,y), for degree-zero homogeneous functions (used in differential equations), F(x,y) = g(y/x). Substituting y = vx and dy/dx = v + x dv/dx converts the equation into one separable in v and x. The source (Section 9.4.2) demonstrates this by showing how substitution reduces the equation to ∫(dv/g(v)-v) = ∫dx/x, enabling integration.","answer_reasoning":"The answer directly references the source's explanation in Section 9.4.2, where homogeneous equations are defined as those where F(x,y) is homogeneous of degree zero. The substitution y = vx is explicitly presented as the method to reduce homogeneous equations to separable form, with the reasoning matching the source's derivation (e.g., Example 10)."}
{"question":"Derive the integrating factor for a first-order linear differential equation dy/dx + P(x)y = Q(x), and explain why multiplying by this factor makes the left-hand side a derivative of a product.","answer":"The integrating factor (I.F.) is e^∫P(x) dx. Multiplying the equation by I.F. gives e^∫P dx dy/dx + P e^∫P dx y = Q e^∫P dx. The left-hand side equals d/dx [y e^∫P dx] because d/dx (y I.F.) = dy/dx I.F. + y d(I.F.)/dx, and d(I.F.)/dx = P I.F. by construction. The source (Section 9.4.3) derives I.F. as e^∫P dx to achieve this form, enabling direct integration to solve for y.","answer_reasoning":"The derivation matches the source's explanation in Section 9.4.3, where I.F. = e^∫P dx is defined to make LHS a derivative.

{"question":"What is the fundamental difference between an algebraic equation and a differential equation? How does this distinction impact the types of solutions we seek for each?","answer":"An algebraic equation involves variables and constants but no derivatives. Its solutions are numerical values that satisfy the equation. In contrast, a differential equation involves derivatives of a function with respect to one or more independent variables. Its solutions are functions (not numerical values) that satisfy the relationship between the function and its derivatives. This distinction impacts the types of solutions we seek because for algebraic equations we're looking for specific numbers, while for differential equations we're seeking functions that satisfy the relationship between the function and its derivatives.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because the source material states 'An equation of the form (1) is known as a differential equation' (where equation 1 is dy/dx = g(x)), which shows differential equations involve derivatives. It also states 'In contrast to the first two equations, the solution of this differential equation is a function φ that will satisfy it' (referring to the differential equation d²y/dx² + y = 0), which shows differential equations have functional solutions.

For the equation $\\frac{dy}{dx} + \\sin\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) = 0$, the term $\\sin\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)$ is not a polynomial in the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$. The source material explicitly states: 'Equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in $y^\\prime$ and degree of such a differential equation can not be defined.' Therefore, because the equation is not a polynomial equation in the highest order derivative (which is $\\frac{dy}{dx}$), the degree is undefined.","answer_reasoning":"This answer correctly cites the source material which defines the degree only for polynomial equations in derivatives. The text gives equation (11) as an example where the degree is not defined, and the reasoning explains why that example fits the definition. The source material states: 'By the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in derivatives, we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order derivative involved in the given differential equation.'

{"question":"Describe the key characteristics that distinguish a homogeneous differential equation from a linear differential equation (first order).","answer":"A homogeneous differential equation is defined as one that can be written in the form $\\frac{dy}{dx} = F\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$, meaning that the right-hand side is a function of the ratio $\\frac{y}{x}$. This is equivalent to the function $F(x,y)$ being homogeneous of degree zero. For example, $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x+y}{x}$ is homogeneous. On the other hand, a first-order linear differential equation is of the form $\\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)$, where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are functions of $x$ only. The key difference is that homogeneous equations can be solved by the substitution $y = vx$ (which transforms them into separable equations), while linear equations require an integrating factor. The source material states: 'A differential equation of the form $\\frac{dy}{dx} = F(x, y)$ is said to be homogeneous if $F(x, y)$ is a homogeneous function of degree zero.' For linear, it states: 'A differential equation of the form $\\frac{dy}{dx} + P y = Q$, where P and Q are constants or functions of x only, is known as a first order linear differential equation.'","answer_reasoning":"This answer correctly distinguishes the two types by their forms and solution methods, as per the source material.

{"question":"What is the relationship between the order of a differential equation and the number of arbitrary constants in its general solution? Explain with an example from the source material.","answer":"The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative present, and the general solution of a differential equation of order $n$ contains exactly $n$ arbitrary constants. For example, the differential equation $\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + y = 0$ (which is of order 2) has the general solution $y = a \\cos x + b \\sin x$, which contains two arbitrary constants $a$ and $b$. The source material states: 'The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution (primitive) of the differential equation.' and in Example 3, the solution of the second-order equation has two arbitrary constants. The text also states in the summary: 'The solution which contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the differential equation is called a general solution.'","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because the source material explicitly states the relationship.

In the equation d²y/dx² + y = 0, the highest-order derivative is d²y/dx² (second derivative), so the order is 2. The source material provides these examples: 'The equations (6), (7) and (8) involve the highest derivative of first, second and third order respectively.

{"question":"Explain the difference between a general solution and a particular solution of a differential equation, using examples from the source material.","answer":"A general solution of a differential equation contains arbitrary constants equal to the order of the differential equation, while a particular solution is obtained by assigning specific values to these arbitrary constants. For example, the general solution of the differential equation d²y/dx² + y = 0 is y = a sin(x + b), where a and b are arbitrary constants. A particular solution would be y = 2 sin(x + π/4), obtained by setting a = 2 and b = π/4.

{"question":"Classify the differential equation (x² + y²)dy = (x² - y²)dx as either homogeneous or non-homogeneous. Justify your classification using the definition from the source material.","answer":"The differential equation (x² + y²)dy = (x² - y²)dx is homogeneous. To classify it, we rewrite it as dy/dx = (x² - y²)/(x² + y²). Now, we check if the right-hand side is a function of y/x. Dividing numerator and denominator by x², we get dy/dx = (1 - (y/x)²)/(1 + (y/x)²), which is a function of y/x. The source material states: 'A differential equation of the form dy/dx = F(x, y) is said to be homogenous if F(x, y) is a homogenous function of degree zero.' It also states: 'A function F(x, y) is said to be homogeneous function of degree n if F(λx, λy) = λⁿF(x, y) for any nonzero constant λ.' For F(x, y) = (x² - y²)/(x² + y²), we have F(λx, λy) = (λ²x² - λ²y²)/(λ²x² + λ²y²) = λ⁰F(x, y), so it's homogeneous of degree 0.","answer_reasoning":"This answer correctly classifies the equation as homogeneous, provides a justification using the definition from the source material, and shows the steps to verify it.

{"question":"According to the source material, what are the three basic methods for solving first-order, first-degree differential equations? Explain one of these methods with an example.","answer":"The three basic methods for solving first-order, first-degree differential equations are: 1) Differential equations with variables separable, 2) Homogeneous differential equations, and 3) Linear differential equations. For the method of variables separable: A first-order first-degree differential equation is of the form dy/dx = F(x, y). If F(x, y) can be expressed as g(x)h(y), then the equation can be rewritten as dy/h(y) = g(x)dx. Both sides can then be integrated to find the solution. For example, for dy/dx = (x+1)/(2-y), we separate variables to get (2-y)dy = (x+1)dx, and integrate to get 2y - y²/2 = x²/2 + x + C, which is the general solution.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately reflects the source material's description of the three methods.

{"question":"Under what conditions is the 'degree' of a differential equation defined according to the source material? Provide an example where the degree is undefined and explain why.","answer":"The degree is defined only when the differential equation is a polynomial equation in its derivatives. If the equation involves non-polynomial functions of derivatives (e.g., trigonometric functions), the degree is undefined. For example, $\\frac{dy}{dx} + \\sin\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) = 0$ has no defined degree because $\\sin\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)$ is not a polynomial in the derivative.","answer_reasoning":"The source explicitly states: 'By the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in derivatives... we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order derivative.'

{"question":"Explain the distinction between the order and degree of a differential equation, and why the degree is not defined for all differential equations.","answer":"The order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest-order derivative present in the equation. For example, in the equation d²y/dx² + y = 0, the order is 2. The degree is defined only when the differential equation is a polynomial equation in its derivatives, and it is the highest power of the highest-order derivative. For instance, the equation (d²y/dx²)³ + (dy/dx)² = 0 has a degree of 3. However, the degree is undefined for equations that are not polynomial in their derivatives, such as d²y/dx² + sin(dy/dx) = 0, because the sine function makes it non-polynomial.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct because the source material explicitly defines order as the highest derivative order and degree as the highest power of the highest-order derivative in a polynomial equation.

{"question":"What criteria must a differential equation meet to be classified as homogeneous, and how does this classification guide the solution process?","answer":"A differential equation is classified as homogeneous if it can be expressed in the form dy/dx = F(x, y), where F(x, y) is a homogeneous function of degree zero. This means F(λx, λy) = F(x, y) for any non-zero λ. For example, the equation dy/dx = (x + 2y)/(x - y) is homogeneous because F(λx, λy) = (λx + 2λy)/(λx - λy) = F(x, y). The classification guides the solution process by enabling the substitution y = vx (or x = vy), which transforms the equation into a separable form. This substitution leverages the property that homogeneous functions depend only on the ratio y/x, allowing variables to be separated for integration.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because the source defines homogeneous differential equations as those where F(x, y) is homogeneous of degree zero (Section 9.4.2). The solution method using y = vx is explicitly described in the source with examples (e.g., Examples 10 and 11), which demonstrate how substitution converts the equation into a separable form."}
{"question":"Why does the general solution of an nth-order differential equation contain exactly n arbitrary constants, and how does this differ from a particular solution?","answer":"The general solution of an nth-order differential equation contains exactly n arbitrary constants because solving an nth-order equation requires n integrations, each introducing one arbitrary constant. For example, the second-order equation d²y/dx² = 0 has the general solution y = C₁x + C₂, where C₁ and C₂ are arbitrary constants. A particular solution is derived from the general solution by assigning specific values to these constants based on initial or boundary conditions, resulting in a solution without arbitrary constants. This is consistent with the source's statement that the number of arbitrary constants in the general solution equals the order of the equation, as seen in Exercise 9.2, Question 11.","answer_reasoning":"This answer aligns with the source material, which states that the general solution contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the differential equation.

{"question":"Describe the condition under which a differential equation can be solved using the variable separation method, and provide an example from the source material.","answer":"A differential equation can be solved using the variable separation method if it can be expressed as dy/dx = g(x)h(y), where g(x) is a function of x alone and h(y) is a function of y alone. This allows the equation to be rearranged into the form dy/h(y) = g(x)dx, which can then be integrated on both sides. For example, the equation dy/dx = (x + 1)/(2 - y) from Example 4 in the source is separable because it can be rewritten as (2 - y)dy = (x + 1)dx. Integrating both sides yields the general solution x² + y² + 2x - 4y + C = 0.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is accurate because the source defines variable separable differential equations as those where F(x, y) = g(x)h(y) (Section 9.4.1), and Example 4 provides a concrete instance of this method. The solution process described matches the source's approach of separating variables and integrating both sides."}
{"question":"Explain the role of the integrating factor in solving first-order linear differential equations, and why it is chosen as e^∫P dx.","answer":"The integrating factor (I.F.) for a first-order linear differential equation of the form dy/dx + Py = Q is chosen as e^∫P dx to transform the left-hand side into the derivative of a product. Specifically, multiplying the equation by the I.F. converts it into d/dx(y · e^∫P dx) = Q · e^∫P dx, which is integrable. The I.F. is derived from the condition that d/dx(I.F.) = P · I.F, ensuring the left-hand side becomes a derivative. For instance, in dy/dx - y = cos x (Example 14), the I.F. is e^∫-1 dx = e^-x, leading to d/dx(y e^-x) = e^-x cos x, which is solvable by integration.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because the source explicitly describes the integrating factor method in Section 9.4.3, where it states that the I.F. = e^∫P dx is chosen to make the left-hand side a derivative.

{"question":"How does one determine the order of a differential equation containing derivatives of varying orders?","answer":"To determine the order of a differential equation containing derivatives of varying orders, identify the highest order derivative present in the equation. For instance, in the differential equation (d³y/dx³) + x²(d²y/dx²)³ = 0, the highest derivative is d³y/dx³, which is a third-order derivative, so the order is 3. This method is consistent with the source material's definition in section 9.2.1, which emphasizes that order is based solely on the highest order derivative.","answer_reasoning":"The source material's section 9.2.1 explicitly states that order is the highest order derivative present.

{"question":"Explain why the differential equation (dy/dx)² + sin(y) = 0 has an order of 1.","answer":"The differential equation (dy/dx)² + sin(y) = 0 has an order of 1 because the highest order derivative present is the first derivative (dy/dx). The order is determined solely by the highest order derivative, not by the powers of derivatives. In this equation, the highest derivative is dy/dx (first order), so the order is 1, as stated in section 9.2.1 of the source material. The presence of (dy/dx)² does not affect the order; it only affects the degree if the equation is a polynomial in derivatives.","answer_reasoning":"The source defines order as the highest order derivative, not the highest power.

{"question":"Describe the process for identifying the order of a differential equation using the example from the source material.","answer":"To identify the order of a differential equation, locate the highest order derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable. For example, in the source material's equation (8), which is (d³y/dx³) + x²(d²y/dx²)³ = 0, the highest derivative is d³y/dx³ (third order), so the order is 3. Similarly, equation (7) has a second-order derivative, so its order is 2. This process is defined in section 9.2.1 of the source, which states that order is the highest order derivative present.","answer_reasoning":"The source provides equations (6), (7), and (8) as examples with orders 1, 2, and 3. The answer correctly references these examples and the source's definition in section 9.2.1."}
{"question":"Why is the order of the differential equation d²y/dx² + y = 0 equal to 2?","answer":"The order of the differential equation d²y/dx² + y = 0 is equal to 2 because the highest order derivative present is d²y/dx², which is a second-order derivative. According to section 9.2.1 of the source material, the order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative involved. Since d²y/dx² is the highest derivative here, the order is 2, as demonstrated in the source's equation (7).","answer_reasoning":"The source explicitly states equation (7) as d²y/dx² + y = 0 with order 2. The answer correctly identifies the highest derivative and references the source's section 9.2.1."}
{"question":"Explain how the order of a differential equation is determined according to the source material, and provide an example that demonstrates this definition.","answer":"The order of a differential equation is determined by the highest order derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable present in the equation. For example, the differential equation (d³y/dx³) + x²(d²y/dx²)³ = 0 has an order of 3 because the highest derivative is the third derivative (d³y/dx³). This definition is explicitly stated in the source material under section 9.2.1, which defines order as 'the order of the highest order derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given differential equation.'","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct because it directly quotes and applies the definition provided in the source material (section 9.2.1). The example given matches the source's equation (8) which is explicitly stated to have order 3, demonstrating that the order is determined solely by the highest derivative present, regardless of other derivatives in the equation."}
{"question":"Why is the highest order derivative the defining characteristic for determining the order of a differential equation, and how does this relate to the solution process?","answer":"The highest order derivative defines the order because it represents the most complex rate of change involved in the equation, which directly determines the number of initial conditions required to find a unique solution. For instance, a second-order differential equation requires two initial conditions to determine the particular solution. This is consistent with the source material's statement that 'the solution which contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the differential equation is called a general solution,' meaning the order directly determines the number of arbitrary constants in the general solution.","answer_reasoning":"This answer correctly identifies the source's definition (section 9.2.1) and connects it to the solution process as described in the Summary section. The source explicitly states that the number of arbitrary constants equals the order of the differential equation, which is a fundamental concept for solving differential equations."}
{"question":"Analyze the differential equation (d⁴y/dx⁴) + sin(y''') = 0 to determine its order. Explain your reasoning based on the source material's definition.","answer":"The order of the differential equation (d⁴y/dx⁴) + sin(y''') = 0 is 4. This is determined by identifying the highest order derivative present in the equation, which is the fourth derivative (d⁴y/dx⁴). The presence of the third derivative (y''') does not affect the order because the definition specifies that order is based solely on the highest order derivative, as stated in the source material: 'Order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given differential equation.'","answer_reasoning":"This answer correctly applies the source's definition (section 9.2.1) to the given equation. The source explicitly states that order is determined by the highest order derivative, regardless of other derivatives present. The equation's highest derivative is fourth order, so its order is 4, matching the definition provided in the source material."}
{"question":"How does the concept of order differ between ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs)? Reference the source material in your explanation.","answer":"The concept of order differs between ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs) in that ODEs involve derivatives with respect to a single independent variable, while PDEs involve derivatives with respect to multiple independent variables. The source material specifically states: 'A differential equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to only one independent variable is called an ordinary differential equation,' and 'there are differential equations involving derivatives with respect to more than one independent variable, called partial differential equations.' The order of an ODE is determined by the highest derivative with respect to its single independent variable, while for PDEs, the order is determined by the highest derivative with respect to any independent variable. The source material focuses exclusively on ODEs, stating 'Now onward, we will use the term 'differential equation' for 'ordinary differential equation.'","answer_reasoning":"This answer accurately reflects the source material's distinction between ODEs and PDEs in the introductory sections. The source explicitly defines ODEs as those with derivatives with respect to a single independent variable and mentions PDEs as involving derivatives with respect to multiple variables. The explanation correctly applies the source's definition of order to ODEs, as the source material focuses on ODEs for the remainder of the chapter."}
{"question":"In the context of the source material, explain why the equation (d²y/dx²) + (dy/dx)³ = 0 has order 2, and discuss how this relates to the methods used to solve such equations.","answer":"The differential equation (d²y/dx²) + (dy/dx)³ = 0 has order 2 because the highest order derivative present is the second derivative (d²y/dx²). This is consistent with the source material's definition in section 9.2.1: 'Order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given differential equation.' The order of an equation determines the solution methods; for example, second-order ODEs typically require different solution techniques than first-order ODEs, as the source material indicates when discussing the classification of differential equations in section 9.1. The equation's order (2) means the general solution will contain two arbitrary constants, as stated in the Summary: 'The solution which contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the differential equation is called a general solution.'","answer_reasoning":"This answer correctly identifies the highest order derivative (second derivative) as the determinant of order, matching the source's definition. It also correctly connects the order to solution methods and the number of arbitrary constants, referencing the source's Summary section which explicitly states the relationship between order and arbitrary constants in the general solution."}
{"question":"How would you determine the order of the differential equation (d³y/dx³)² + (d²y/dx²)³ = sin(x)?","answer":"The order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given differential equation. In this equation, the highest order derivative present is d³y/dx³, which is a third-order derivative. Therefore, the order of the differential equation is 3.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately applies the definition of order from the source material. The source states: 'Order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given differential equation.' The highest order derivative present in the equation is d³y/dx³ (third derivative), so the order is 3."}
{"question":"Explain the relationship between the order of a differential equation and the number of arbitrary constants in its general solution.","answer":"The order of a differential equation directly determines the number of arbitrary constants in its general solution. For a differential equation of order n, the general solution will contain exactly n arbitrary constants. This is because solving a differential equation of order n requires n integrations, each introducing one arbitrary constant. For example, a first-order differential equation will have a general solution with one arbitrary constant, a second-order differential equation will have a general solution with two arbitrary constants, and so on.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately describes the relationship between the order of a differential equation and the number of arbitrary constants in its general solution. The source material states: 'The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution (primitive) of the differential equation.' It also states: 'The number of arbitrary constants in the general solution of a differential equation of fourth order are: (D) 4' (from Exercise 9.2, Question 11). This confirms that the order of a differential equation equals the number of arbitrary constants in its general solution."}
{"question":"Why is it important to determine the order of a differential equation before attempting to solve it?","answer":"Determining the order of a differential equation is important because it informs us about the complexity of the problem and guides our choice of solution method. The order indicates the highest derivative present, which tells us how many times we'll need to integrate to find the general solution. It also helps us determine the number of initial conditions required to find a particular solution. For example, a first-order differential equation will require one initial condition, while a second-order equation will require two. Additionally, the order can help us classify the equation (e.g., whether it's a first-order or second-order linear equation), which influences the solution approach.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately explains the importance of determining the order of a differential equation. The source material states that 'Order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given differential equation.' This definition directly informs us about the highest derivative, which in turn tells us about the complexity of the equation and the number of integrations needed to solve it."}
{"question":"How is the order of a differential equation different from its degree? Provide an example of each.","answer":"The order of a differential equation refers to the highest order derivative present in the equation, while the degree refers to the highest power of the highest order derivative, provided the equation is a polynomial in its derivatives. For example, the differential equation d²y/dx² + 3(dy/dx) = 5 has order 2 (because the highest order derivative is the second derivative), and the equation (d²y/dx²)³ + (dy/dx)² = 7 has degree 3 (because the highest order derivative is squared to the third power).","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately distinguishes between order and degree, and provides examples that align with the source material. The source clearly defines order as the highest order derivative and degree as the highest power of the highest order derivative (for polynomial equations in derivatives). The source states: 'Order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given differential equation.' It also states: 'By the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in derivatives, we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order derivative involved in the given differential equation.'"}
{"question":"How would you determine the order of a differential equation if it's written in terms of differentials rather than derivatives?","answer":"To determine the order of a differential equation written in terms of differentials, we need to identify the highest order derivative present in the equation. For example, if we have an equation like x² dy² + 3x dy dx - 2y dx² = 0, we would first rewrite it in terms of derivatives. This equation can be rewritten as x² (dy/dx)² + 3x (dy/dx) - 2y = 0. The highest order derivative present is dy/dx, which is a first-order derivative, so the order of the equation is 1. In general, the order is determined by the highest derivative, regardless of whether it's written in differential form or derivative form.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately explains how to determine the order of a differential equation written in differential form. The source material states that 'a differential equation is an equation involving derivative (derivatives) of the dependent variable with respect to independent variable (variables).' It also provides examples like 'x dy/dx + y = 0' (equation 4), which is written in terms of derivatives. The key is to identify the highest order derivative, whether it's written as a derivative or in differential form."}

{"question":"Explain why the order of a differential equation is fundamentally important for classifying and solving such equations, as described in the source material.","answer":"The order of a differential equation is fundamental because it determines the number of initial conditions required for a unique solution and dictates the solution method. The source material states that the general solution of an nth-order differential equation contains exactly n arbitrary constants, which must be determined using n initial conditions. This classification is essential for selecting appropriate solution techniques, as first-order equations require different methods than second-order equations, for example.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct because it accurately reflects the source material's explanation in section 9.3, which states 'The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution... The number of arbitrary constants in the general solution of a differential equation of nth order is n.' The importance of order for determining solution methods is a core concept in differential equations as presented in the source."}

The degree is undefined for equations that aren't polynomial in derivatives, such as equation (11) which contains sin(dy/dx), as the source states 'the degree of differential equation (11) is not defined' because it's not a polynomial equation in derivatives.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct because it directly references the definitions and examples from sections 9.2.1 (order) and 9.2.2 (degree) in the source material. The source explicitly states that degree is undefined when the equation isn't polynomial in derivatives, as demonstrated with equation (11), and provides examples (9) and (10) for degree 1 and 2 respectively."}
{"question":"Why can the order of a differential equation never be a non-integer value according to the source material, and what specific statement confirms this constraint?","answer":"The order of a differential equation cannot be a non-integer because it is defined as the order of the highest-order derivative, which is inherently a positive integer. The source material explicitly states in the note: 'Order and degree (if defined) of a differential equation are always positive integers,' confirming that non-integer orders are mathematically invalid by definition.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct because it directly quotes the note from the source material that states 'Order and degree (if defined) of a differential equation are always positive integers.' This statement is the authoritative source confirming that order must be a positive integer, making non-integer orders impossible."}
{"question":"How does the source material explain the relationship between the order of a differential equation and the number of arbitrary constants in its general solution?","answer":"The source material explains that the number of arbitrary constants in the general solution of a differential equation is exactly equal to its order. For an nth-order differential equation, the general solution contains n arbitrary constants. This is because solving an nth-order equation requires n integrations, each introducing one arbitrary constant, as stated in section 9.3: 'The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution... The number of arbitrary constants in the general solution of a differential equation of nth order is n.'","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct because it directly quotes the key statement from section 9.3 of the source material, which explicitly defines the relationship between order and the number of arbitrary constants. The source's wording matches the answer's explanation exactly, confirming the correctness of the relationship described."}

It also provides Exercise 9.2, question 11, which states: 'The number of arbitrary constants in the general solution of a differential equation of fourth order are: (D) 4.' This confirms that the number of arbitrary constants equals the order of the differential equation, as each integration step introduces one constant and the number of integrations equals the order."}
{"question":"Why must the order of a differential equation always be a positive integer, and how does this relate to the definition of derivatives?","answer":"The order of a differential equation must always be a positive integer because it represents the order of the highest order derivative present in the equation. Derivatives are defined for positive integer orders (first derivative, second derivative, etc.), and there is no concept of a fractional or negative order derivative in the context of determining the order of a differential equation.

{"question":"Explain why the degree of a differential equation is undefined for equations involving non-polynomial functions of derivatives, such as sin(dy/dx) or e^(d²y/dx²).","answer":"The degree of a differential equation is only defined when the equation is a polynomial in its derivatives. Non-polynomial functions of derivatives, such as trigonometric or exponential expressions (e.g., sin(dy/dx) or e^(d²y/dx²)), make the equation non-polynomial in derivatives.

Equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in y' and degree of such a differential equation cannot be defined.' This confirms that non-polynomial terms in derivatives invalidate the degree definition."}
{"question":"How does the degree of a differential equation differ from its order, and what conditions must be satisfied for the degree to be defined?","answer":"The order of a differential equation is the highest order of the derivative present, while the degree is the highest power of the highest-order derivative, but only if the equation is a polynomial in its derivatives. For the degree to be defined, the differential equation must be expressible as a polynomial in all its derivatives (e.g., terms like (d²y/dx²)^3 are allowed, but sin(dy/dx) is not).","answer_reasoning":"The source states: 'Order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative...

{"question":"What is the significance of the requirement that a differential equation must be a polynomial in derivatives for its degree to be defined, and how does this affect the classification of differential equations?","answer":"This requirement ensures that the degree can be consistently calculated as a positive integer exponent of the highest-order derivative. If the equation is not polynomial in derivatives (e.g., involving sin(dy/dx) or e^(d²y/dx²)), the degree cannot be defined, which affects the equation's classification and solution methods. Polynomial-in-derivatives equations are a distinct class with well-defined properties for analysis.","answer_reasoning":"The source states: 'To study the degree of a differential equation, the key point is that the differential equation must be a polynomial equation in derivatives, i.e., y', y'', y''' etc.' It further clarifies that non-polynomial equations like (11) have undefined degree, emphasizing that this condition is fundamental to degree definition."}
{"question":"For the differential equation (dy/dx)^2 + d²y/dx² = 0, determine its degree and explain why the square of the first derivative does not affect the degree calculation.","answer":"The degree of this equation is 1. The highest-order derivative is d²y/dx² (order 2), which is raised to the first power. The (dy/dx)^2 term involves a lower-order derivative (first order), so its power does not influence the degree. The degree is solely determined by the highest-order derivative's highest power.","answer_reasoning":"The source states: 'By the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in derivatives, we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order derivative involved.'

{"question":"Explain the conditions under which the degree of a differential equation is defined, and provide an example where it is undefined.","answer":"The degree of a differential equation is defined only when the equation is a polynomial in its derivatives. Specifically, the equation must be expressible as a polynomial in the highest order derivative and all lower-order derivatives, with the highest power being a positive integer. If the equation involves non-polynomial functions of derivatives (e.g., trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic functions of derivatives), the degree is undefined. For example, the differential equation $\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\sin\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) = 0$ has an undefined degree because $\\sin\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)$ is not a polynomial term.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately reflects the source material's definition: 'degree of such differential equations can be defined' only when it's a polynomial in derivatives (e.g., equation 9), while 'equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in $y'$ and degree... not defined.' The example given matches equation (11) in the source material, confirming the reasoning."}
{"question":"How does the degree of a differential equation differ from its order, and why is this distinction important?","answer":"The order of a differential equation is the highest derivative order present (e.g., $\\frac{d^3y}{dx^3}$ makes it a third-order equation), while the degree is the highest power of the highest-order derivative, but only if the equation is polynomial in its derivatives. For example, $\\left(\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\\right)^3 + \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$ has order 2 and degree 3. This distinction is important because the degree must be a positive integer (as stated in the source: 'Order and degree (if defined) are always positive integers'), whereas the order is always a positive integer by definition.","answer_reasoning":"The answer correctly distinguishes order (highest derivative order) and degree (highest power of highest-order derivative in polynomial form), as defined in the source. The example aligns with the source's examples (equations 6–8 for order, equation 9 for degree 1, equation 10 for degree 2).

{"question":"Why is the degree of the differential equation $\\frac{dy}{dx} + \\sin\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) = 0$ not defined, and what property of the equation causes this?","answer":"The degree is not defined because the equation is not a polynomial in the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$. Specifically, the term $\\sin\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)$ is a non-polynomial function of the derivative. The source material states that 'equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in $y'$ and degree of such a differential equation can not be defined,' which directly matches this example.","answer_reasoning":"This answer correctly identifies the non-polynomial nature of the equation as the reason for undefined degree, citing the source's explicit example (equation 11).

Its degree is 2 because the highest power of the highest-order derivative ($\\frac{dy}{dx}$) is 2, and the equation is a polynomial in $\\frac{dy}{dx}$. In contrast, $\\frac{dy}{dx} + \\sin\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) = 0$ has an undefined degree because $\\sin\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)$ is not a polynomial term, as noted in the source material (equations 10 and 11).","answer_reasoning":"The answer correctly cites equation (10) from the source as the degree-2 example and equation (11) as the undefined case.

{"question":"Why must the degree of a differential equation be a positive integer, and what would happen if it were zero or negative?","answer":"The degree must be a positive integer because it represents the highest power of the highest-order derivative in a polynomial equation. By definition, the degree is the 'highest power (positive integral index)' of the highest-order derivative (source: 'By the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in derivatives, we mean the highest power (positive integral index)...'). A degree of zero or negative would violate this definition, as powers must be positive integers (e.g., $y' = 0$ has degree 1, not 0).","answer_reasoning":"The answer directly quotes the source's definition: 'highest power (positive integral index)' and states that degree must be a positive integer.

{"question":"What is the precise definition of the degree of a differential equation, and under what conditions is the degree defined for a given differential equation?","answer":"The degree of a differential equation is defined as the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order derivative present in the equation, but only if the differential equation is a polynomial equation in its derivatives. The degree is not defined for differential equations that are not polynomial in their derivatives. For example, in equation (11) from the source material, the degree is not defined because it's not a polynomial equation in y'.","answer_reasoning":"This answer correctly states that the degree is defined only for polynomial equations in derivatives, and that it's the highest power of the highest order derivative.

{"question":"Why is the degree of the differential equation dy/dx + sin(dy/dx) = 0 not defined, and how does this differ from a differential equation like (dy/dx)^2 + dy/dx - sin^2(y) = 0?","answer":"The degree of the differential equation dy/dx + sin(dy/dx) = 0 is not defined because it's not a polynomial equation in its derivatives. The sine function of the derivative makes it a transcendental function rather than a polynomial. In contrast, the equation (dy/dx)^2 + dy/dx - sin^2(y) = 0 is a polynomial equation in dy/dx (the highest order derivative), so its degree is defined as 2, the highest power of dy/dx.","answer_reasoning":"The source material specifically addresses this distinction in equations (10) and (11). Equation (10) is a polynomial in y' (degree 2) while equation (11) is not a polynomial in y' (degree undefined). The key point is whether the equation is a polynomial in the derivatives."}
{"question":"How would you determine the degree of a differential equation like d^3y/dx^3 + 2(d^2y/dx^2)^2 - dy/dx + y = 0, and what factors would affect your determination?","answer":"For the differential equation d^3y/dx^3 + 2(d^2y/dx^2)^2 - dy/dx + y = 0, the degree is 1. To determine the degree, I first check if the equation is a polynomial in its derivatives. Since all terms are polynomials in the derivatives (d^3y/dx^3, d^2y/dx^2, dy/dx), the equation is a polynomial in derivatives. Then, I identify the highest order derivative, which is d^3y/dx^3. The highest power of this highest order derivative is 1 (since it's raised to the first power), so the degree is 1.","answer_reasoning":"The source material states: 'By the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in derivatives, we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order derivative involved in the given differential equation.'

It also states 'Order and degree (if defined) of a differential equation are always positive integers.'"}
{"question":"In what scenarios would you not be able to determine the degree of a differential equation, and what would be the implications for solving such an equation?","answer":"The degree of a differential equation cannot be determined when the equation is not a polynomial in its derivatives. This happens when the equation contains transcendental functions of the derivatives (like sin(dy/dx), cos(dy/dx), e^(dy/dx), etc.) or when the derivatives are raised to non-integer powers. For example, in the equation dy/dx + sin(dy/dx) = 0, the degree is not defined because of the sine function. The implication is that standard methods for solving differential equations based on degree (like certain methods for first-degree equations) might not be applicable, and we would need to use alternative methods to solve the equation.","answer_reasoning":"The source material specifically states that 'equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in y' and degree of such a differential equation can not be defined.'

{"question":"Explain the condition that must be satisfied for the degree of a differential equation to be defined, and provide an example of a differential equation for which the degree is not defined.","answer":"The degree of a differential equation is defined only when the equation is a polynomial in its derivatives. This means that the derivatives (such as y', y'', etc.) must appear as terms raised to a non-negative integer power, and there should be no transcendental functions (like sine, cosine, exponential) of the derivatives.

{"question":"How does the degree of a differential equation differ from its order? Provide an example of a differential equation of order 2 and degree 1, and another of order 2 and degree 2.","answer":"The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative present, while the degree is the highest power of the highest order derivative (only when the equation is a polynomial in derivatives). For example, the equation d²y/dx² + (dy/dx)² = 0 has order 2 and degree 1 because the highest order derivative (d²y/dx²) is raised to the first power. Another example is (d²y/dx²)² + dy/dx = 0, which has order 2 and degree 2 because the highest order derivative is squared.","answer_reasoning":"This answer correctly distinguishes between order and degree as defined in the source. The source defines order as 'the order of the highest order derivative' (equations 6-8) and degree as 'the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order derivative' (equations 9-11). The examples align with the source's examples: equation (9) is a third-order equation with degree 1, and equation (10) is first-order with degree 2. For order 2, we can construct examples as shown, which are consistent with the source's principles."}
{"question":"Why is the degree of a differential equation not defined in cases where the equation involves trigonometric functions of the derivatives? Give an example and explain.","answer":"The degree is not defined when the differential equation involves trigonometric functions of derivatives because the equation must be a polynomial in its derivatives to have a defined degree. Trigonometric functions are transcendental, so they prevent the equation from being a polynomial. For example, in the equation (dy/dx) + sin(dy/dx) = 0, the presence of sin(dy/dx) means it is not a polynomial equation in dy/dx, so the degree is undefined.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct because the source explicitly states: 'equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in y' and 'degree of such a differential equation can not be defined'. The source defines degree only for polynomial equations in derivatives, and trigonometric functions make the equation non-polynomial. The example matches equation (11) from the source material."}
{"question":"According to the standard definition, what is the degree of a differential equation? Clarify why the degree must be a positive integer and how it is determined from the highest order derivative.","answer":"The degree of a differential equation is defined as the highest power (with a positive integer index) of the highest order derivative in the equation, provided the equation is a polynomial in its derivatives. The degree must be a positive integer because it represents the exponent of the highest order derivative, and the definition specifies 'positive integral index'. For example, in the equation (d²y/dx²)³ + dy/dx = 0, the highest order derivative is d²y/dx² (order 2), and it is raised to the power 3, so the degree is 3.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct as per the source material.

{"question":"For the differential equation d²y/dx² + (dy/dx)³ + sin(dy/dx) = 0, determine its order and degree, and justify your answer.","answer":"The order of this differential equation is 2 because the highest order derivative present is d²y/dx² (a second derivative). The degree is not defined because the equation is not a polynomial in its derivatives. Specifically, the term sin(dy/dx) is a transcendental function of the first derivative, making the equation non-polynomial. Since the degree can only be defined for polynomial equations in derivatives, it is not defined here.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct as per the source. The source explicitly defines order as 'the order of the highest order derivative' (equations 6-8) and states that degree is defined only for polynomial equations in derivatives (equations 9-11). Equation (11) in the source is dy/dx + sin(dy/dx) = 0, which is given as having undefined degree. The given equation has the same issue (sin(dy/dx) term) and also has a second derivative, so order is 2 and degree is undefined. The source states: 'equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in y' and 'degree of such a differential equation can not be defined', which directly applies to this example."}
{"question":"Explain the difference between a general solution and a particular solution of a differential equation, and provide an example from the source material to illustrate your explanation.","answer":"The general solution of a differential equation contains arbitrary constants (as many as the order of the equation) and represents the entire family of solutions. A particular solution is a specific solution obtained by assigning particular values to the arbitrary constants in the general solution, making it free from arbitrary constants. For example, the source material states that for the differential equation $\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + y = 0$, the general solution is $y = a \\sin(x + b)$ (where $a$ and $b$ are arbitrary constants), while a particular solution is $y = 2 \\sin\\left(x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$ obtained by setting $a = 2$ and $b = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct because the source material explicitly defines: 'The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution (primitive) of the differential equation.

{"question":"How many arbitrary constants should a general solution of an nth-order ordinary differential equation contain? Justify your answer with reference to the source material.","answer":"A general solution of an nth-order ordinary differential equation must contain exactly n arbitrary constants. This is because the solution process involves n integrations, each introducing one arbitrary constant. The source material confirms this in Exercise 9.2, Question 11: 'The number of arbitrary constants in the general solution of a differential equation of fourth order are: (D) 4.' Similarly, for a third-order equation, the number of arbitrary constants in the general solution would be three, as indicated in Exercise 9.2, Question 12 (which addresses the particular solution having zero arbitrary constants).","answer_reasoning":"The source material directly supports this principle. The text states that the general solution contains arbitrary constants equal to the order of the equation, as demonstrated in Examples 2 and 3. For instance, the second-order equation $\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + y = 0$ has a general solution with two arbitrary constants ($a$ and $b$), matching its order. Exercise 9.2, Question 11 explicitly confirms that a fourth-order equation's general solution has four arbitrary constants, and Question 12 implies that a third-order equation's general solution has three arbitrary constants (since the particular solution has none)."}
{"question":"Explain the process of verifying that a given function is a particular solution of a differential equation, using an example from the source material.","answer":"To verify a function as a particular solution, substitute the function and its necessary derivatives into the differential equation and confirm both sides are equal. For example, the source material (Example 2) verifies $y = e^{-3x}$ for $\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + \\frac{dy}{dx} - 6y = 0$. First, compute $\\frac{dy}{dx} = -3e^{-3x}$ and $\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = 9e^{-3x}$. Substituting: LHS = $9e^{-3x} + (-3e^{-3x}) - 6(e^{-3x}) = 0$, which equals the RHS. Since this holds true, $y = e^{-3x}$ is verified as a particular solution.","answer_reasoning":"This explanation is factually correct as per the source material.

The process described matches the source material exactly."}
{"question":"Why are arbitrary constants necessary in the general solution of a differential equation? How do they relate to the concept of a family of curves?","answer":"Arbitrary constants are necessary because a differential equation of order n has infinitely many solutions, forming a family of curves. Each arbitrary constant represents a degree of freedom that accounts for different initial conditions. For example, the general solution $y = a \\sin(x + b)$ for $\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + y = 0$ represents a family of sine curves (with different amplitudes and phases). When specific values are chosen for $a$ and $b$, a particular curve from this family is obtained (e.g., $a=2$, $b=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ gives $y = 2 \\sin\\left(x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$).

The example of $y = a \\sin(x + b)$ having two arbitrary constants for a second-order equation is explicitly given in the source, and the concept of the family of curves is inherent in this explanation."}
{"question":"Describe the relationship between the general solution and the particular solution of a differential equation. How is a particular solution derived from the general solution?","answer":"The general solution contains arbitrary constants and represents all possible solutions (a family of solutions). A particular solution is a specific solution derived from the general solution by assigning fixed numerical values to the arbitrary constants. This assignment is typically based on initial conditions or boundary conditions. For instance, the source material shows that for $\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + y = 0$, the general solution is $y = a \\cos x + b \\sin x$ (with arbitrary constants $a$ and $b$). A particular solution is obtained by choosing specific values, such as $a = 2$ and $b = 0$, yielding $y = 2 \\cos x$.

{"question":"Explain why the number of arbitrary constants in the general solution of an nth-order differential equation equals n.","answer":"The general solution of an nth-order differential equation contains exactly n arbitrary constants because each integration step to solve the differential equation introduces one constant of integration. For example, solving a first-order ODE requires one integration, resulting in one constant; a second-order ODE requires two integrations, yielding two constants, and so on. This aligns with the definition in Section 9.3 where the general solution includes parameters equal to the order, such as y = a sin(x + b) for the second-order equation y'' + y = 0, which has two arbitrary constants (a and b).","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately states that the number of arbitrary constants equals the order due to integration steps, and references the source material's example (Section 9.3, general solution for y'' + y = 0 with two constants a and b).

{"question":"Provide an example of a general solution and a corresponding particular solution for the differential equation y'' + y = 0, explaining how the particular solution is derived from the general solution.","answer":"A general solution for y'' + y = 0 is y = a cos x + b sin x, where a and b are arbitrary constants. A particular solution can be obtained by assigning specific values to these constants; for instance, if a = 0 and b = 1, the particular solution becomes y = sin x. This is derived by substituting the chosen values of a and b into the general solution, which satisfies the differential equation for those specific constants.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it directly cites Section 9.3, Example 3, which presents y = a cos x + b sin x as the general solution for y'' + y = 0.

{"question":"Describe the process of converting a general solution into a particular solution, and explain why this process is necessary for solving initial value problems.","answer":"To convert a general solution into a particular solution, specific values are assigned to the arbitrary constants based on initial conditions.

{"question":"How can you distinguish between a general solution and a particular solution of a differential equation?","answer":"A general solution of a differential equation contains arbitrary constants (parameters) that can take any value, representing a family of solutions. In contrast, a particular solution does not contain any arbitrary constants and represents a specific solution that satisfies both the differential equation and specific initial or boundary conditions.

{"question":"Explain the process of obtaining a particular solution from a general solution of a differential equation.","answer":"To obtain a particular solution from a general solution, specific values must be assigned to the arbitrary constants in the general solution. These values are typically determined by applying initial or boundary conditions to the differential equation. For instance, if the general solution of a differential equation is y = a sin(x+b), and we have the condition that y = 1 when x = 0, we substitute these values into the general solution to solve for the constants. This gives specific values for a and b, resulting in a particular solution that satisfies both the differential equation and the given condition. For example, substituting y = 1 and x = 0 might yield a = 2 and b = π/4, giving the particular solution y = 2 sin(x + π/4).","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct based on the source material. The source provides multiple examples of this process. In Example 6, the source states: 'Substituting y=1 and x=0 in equation (2), we get, C=-1.

Similarly, in Example 7, the source states: 'Substituting x=1, y=1 in equation (2), we get C=0. Now substituting the value of C in equation (2) we get the equation of the required curve as y=x²+log|x|.' This demonstrates the standard process of using specific conditions to determine the arbitrary constants in the general solution."}
{"question":"Why is it necessary to verify a function as a solution to a differential equation before considering it a valid general or particular solution?","answer":"Verification is necessary because a function must satisfy the differential equation for all values of the independent variable in its domain to be considered a valid solution. Simply having a function with the correct number of arbitrary constants does not guarantee it satisfies the differential equation. Verification involves substituting the function and its derivatives into the differential equation to confirm that the left-hand side equals the right-hand side. For example, to verify that y = e^(-3x) is a solution of y'' + y' - 6y = 0, we would calculate y' = -3e^(-3x), y'' = 9e^(-3x), substitute these into the equation, and confirm that 9e^(-3x) + (-3e^(-3x)) - 6e^(-3x) = 0 for all x.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct based on the source material. The source provides explicit verification examples in Examples 2 and 3. In Example 2, the source states: 'Given function is y=e^(-3x). Differentiating both sides of equation with respect to x, we get dy/dx = -3e^(-3x). Now, differentiating (1) with respect to x, we have d²y/dx² = 9e^(-3x). Substituting the values of d²y/dx², dy/dx and y in the given differential equation, we get L.H.S. = 9e^(-3x) + (-3e^(-3x)) - 6.e^(-3x) = 9e^(-3x) - 9e^(-3x) = 0 = R.H.S.' The source also verifies solutions in Example 3 using the same method, confirming that verification is a necessary step to ensure a function is a valid solution."}
{"question":"How do initial conditions affect the determination of a particular solution from the general solution of a differential equation?","answer":"Initial conditions provide specific values that help determine the exact values of the arbitrary constants in the general solution. For a differential equation of order n, n initial conditions are typically required to determine the n arbitrary constants. By substituting the initial conditions into the general solution (and possibly its derivatives), we obtain a system of equations that can be solved for the constants. For example, for a second-order differential equation (requiring two initial conditions), we would use two specific values (e.g., y(x₀) = y₀ and y'(x₀) = y₁) to solve for the two arbitrary constants in the general solution. Once these constants are determined, the general solution becomes a particular solution that satisfies both the differential equation and the initial conditions.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct based on the source material. The source consistently uses initial conditions to determine particular solutions, as shown in Examples 6, 7, and 8.

{"question":"Explain the relationship between the order of a differential equation and the number of arbitrary constants in its general solution, providing a concrete example from the source material.","answer":"The number of arbitrary constants in the general solution of a differential equation is equal to the order of the equation.

{"question":"Describe the process of obtaining a particular solution from a general solution, and explain why this process is necessary in practical applications of differential equations.","answer":"A particular solution is obtained by assigning specific numerical values to the arbitrary constants in the general solution. This process is necessary because practical applications require solutions that satisfy specific initial or boundary conditions. For instance, in Example 6, the general solution y = 1/(2x² - C) is transformed into the particular solution y = 1/(2x² + 1) by substituting the initial condition y=1 when x=0. This is essential because the general solution represents a family of curves, while a particular solution corresponds to a specific curve that satisfies given conditions.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately describes the process of obtaining a particular solution by assigning values to arbitrary constants, and explains the necessity using the source's Example 6.

{"question":"Why can't a particular solution contain arbitrary constants, and how does this differ from the general solution in terms of mathematical representation?","answer":"A particular solution cannot contain arbitrary constants because it represents a specific solution that satisfies both the differential equation and given initial conditions. In contrast, the general solution contains arbitrary constants to represent the entire family of solutions. The source states: 'The solution free from arbitrary constants i.e., the solution obtained from the general solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular solution.'

{"question":"Explain how the concept of general and particular solutions relates to the physical interpretation of differential equations in real-world applications, using an example from the source material.","answer":"General solutions represent all possible behaviors of a system described by a differential equation, while particular solutions correspond to specific scenarios based on initial conditions. For example, in the banking application (Example 9), the general solution P = Ce^(t/20) represents all possible growth scenarios, while the particular solution P = 1000e^(t/20) (with C=1000) represents the specific case of starting with Rs 1000. The particular solution is necessary to answer questions like 'how long until the principal doubles,' which requires specific initial conditions that the general solution alone cannot provide.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it connects the mathematical concepts to a real-world application from the source material. Example 9 in the source demonstrates the general solution P = Ce^(t/20) and the particular solution P = 1000e^(t/20) derived by substituting the initial condition P=1000 when t=0, showing how the particular solution is needed for specific applications."}
{"question":"Discuss why the concept of arbitrary constants is essential for understanding the difference between general and particular solutions, and how this relates to the uniqueness of solutions in differential equations.","answer":"Arbitrary constants are essential because they allow the general solution to represent the entire family of solutions to a differential equation. The number of arbitrary constants equals the order of the equation, as stated in the source: 'The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution (primitive) of the differential equation.' For example, the second-order equation d²y/dx² + y = 0 has a general solution with two arbitrary constants. Without these constants, we couldn't represent all possible solutions. A particular solution is obtained by fixing these constants based on initial conditions, ensuring uniqueness for specific scenarios. This is demonstrated in the source when it states: 'The solution free from arbitrary constants... is called a particular solution,' highlighting the necessity of arbitrary constants for the general solution and their removal for the particular solution.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately explains the role of arbitrary constants, citing the source's definitions and examples. The source explicitly states that the general solution contains arbitrary constants ('The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution') and that the particular solution is obtained by removing them ('The solution free from arbitrary constants... is called a particular solution'). The example of the second-order equation with two arbitrary constants directly supports this explanation."}
{"question":"Explain how the order of a differential equation relates to the number of arbitrary constants in its general solution.","answer":"The order of a differential equation directly determines the number of arbitrary constants in its general solution. For an nth-order differential equation, the general solution will contain exactly n arbitrary constants. This is because solving an nth-order differential equation requires n integrations, each introducing one arbitrary constant. For example, the second-order differential equation y'' + y = 0 has a general solution y = a cos x + b sin x containing two arbitrary constants (a and b), matching the equation's order. Similarly, a first-order differential equation would have one arbitrary constant in its general solution.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately describes the relationship between order and number of arbitrary constants, which is explicitly stated in the source material. Example 3 shows the second-order equation y'' + y = 0 with general solution containing two arbitrary constants (a and b). Exercise 9.2, Question 11 confirms that a fourth-order differential equation has four arbitrary constants in its general solution, validating the relationship between order and number of arbitrary constants."}
{"question":"How does one obtain a particular solution from a general solution of a differential equation?","answer":"A particular solution is obtained by assigning specific numerical values to the arbitrary constants in the general solution. This is typically done by using initial or boundary conditions provided with the problem. For example, for the general solution y = C1 cos x + C2 sin x of the differential equation y'' + y = 0, if given initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = 3, substituting x=0 and y=2 into the general solution gives 2 = C1, and substituting into the derivative y' = -C1 sin x + C2 cos x gives 3 = C2, resulting in the particular solution y = 2 cos x + 3 sin x.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately describes the process of obtaining a particular solution from a general solution by assigning specific values to arbitrary constants, which is explicitly stated in the source material. The source states: 'The solution free from arbitrary constants i.e., the solution obtained from the general solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular solution of the differential equation.' Example 6 demonstrates this process with specific initial conditions (y=1 when x=0) to find the particular solution."}
{"question":"Why is the general solution of a differential equation called 'general'?","answer":"The general solution is called 'general' because it represents the entire family of solutions to the differential equation. It contains arbitrary constants that can be adjusted to satisfy various initial or boundary conditions, making it applicable to all possible scenarios. For example, the general solution y = a cos x + b sin x for the differential equation y'' + y = 0 contains two arbitrary constants (a and b), and by choosing specific values for these constants (e.g., a=2, b=π/4), we obtain particular solutions like y = 2 sin(x + π/4) that satisfy specific conditions. The term 'general' signifies that it encompasses all possible solutions before specific conditions are applied.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately explains the meaning of 'general' in the context of differential equations, as defined in the source material.

{"question":"Explain the process of verifying whether a given function is a solution to a differential equation.","answer":"To verify a function as a solution to a differential equation, follow these steps: (1) Compute all necessary derivatives of the function; (2) Substitute the function and its derivatives into the differential equation; (3) Simplify both sides to check if they are equal. If the left-hand side (L.H.S.) equals the right-hand side (R.H.S.), the function is a valid solution. For example, to verify y = e^(-3x) is a solution to y'' + y' - 6y = 0: (1) Compute y' = -3e^(-3x), y'' = 9e^(-3x); (2) Substitute: L.H.S. = 9e^(-3x) + (-3e^(-3x)) - 6e^(-3x); (3) Simplify to get 0 = R.H.S., confirming it's a solution.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately describes the verification process as demonstrated in the source material. Example 2 explicitly shows the verification process: 'Given function is y = e^(-3x). Differentiating both sides... we get y' = -3e^(-3x)... y'' = 9e^(-3x). Substituting the values of y'', y', and y in the given differential equation, we get L.H.S. = 9e^(-3x) + (-3e^(-3x)) - 6e^(-3x) = 0 = R.H.S.' This step-by-step method is clearly outlined in the source, confirming its accuracy."}
{"question":"What is the significance of arbitrary constants in the general solution of a differential equation?","answer":"Arbitrary constants in the general solution represent the degrees of freedom in the solution space. Each constant corresponds to a condition that can be specified to determine a unique particular solution. For an nth-order differential equation, there are exactly n arbitrary constants, meaning n initial or boundary conditions are required to find a specific solution. For example, the general solution y = C1e^(2x) + C2e^(-x) for the second-order equation y'' - y' - 2y = 0 has two arbitrary constants, so two conditions (e.g., y(0) = 1, y'(0) = 0) are needed to solve for C1 and C2, yielding a unique particular solution.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately explains the significance of arbitrary constants as described in the source material. The source states: 'The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution (primitive) of the differential equation.' It also explains that 'the solution obtained from the general solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular solution.' The source's examples (e.g., Example 3 with two arbitrary constants for a second-order equation) and Exercise 9.2, Question 11 (which confirms the number of arbitrary constants equals the order of the equation) validate this explanation."}
{"question":"What condition must the function F(x, y) satisfy for a first-order differential equation dy/dx = F(x, y) to be classified as a variable separable differential equation?","answer":"For a differential equation to be variable separable, the function F(x, y) must be expressible as a product of a function of x alone and a function of y alone, i.e., F(x, y) = g(x)h(y). This allows the equation to be rewritten as (1/h(y)) dy = g(x) dx, enabling separation of variables and subsequent integration.","answer_reasoning":"This is correct as per Section 9.4.1, which states: 'If F(x, y) can be expressed as a product g(x) h(y), where g(x) is a function of x and h(y) is a function of y, then the differential equation is said to be of variable separable type.'"}
{"question":"Describe the step-by-step process for solving a variable separable differential equation, including how the arbitrary constant is incorporated in the general solution.","answer":"The solution process involves: (1) rewriting the equation in the form (1/h(y)) dy = g(x) dx, (2) integrating both sides to obtain ∫(1/h(y)) dy = ∫g(x) dx, (3) solving for y (if possible) to express the general solution as H(y) = G(x) + C, where H and G are antiderivatives of 1/h(y) and g(x), respectively, and C is the arbitrary constant. This constant accounts for the family of solutions satisfying the differential equation.","answer_reasoning":"The source in Section 9.4.1 states: 'Integrating both sides of (3), we get ∫(1/h(y)) dy = ∫g(x) dx.

{"question":"Given the differential equation dy/dx = -4xy² with the initial condition y = 1 when x = 0, explain the method used to find its particular solution.","answer":"First, separate variables: (1/y²) dy = -4x dx. Then integrate both sides: ∫y⁻² dy = -4 ∫x dx, resulting in -1/y = -2x² + C. Apply the initial condition: 1 = 1/(2(0)² - C) ⇒ C = -1. Substitute C to get the particular solution y = 1/(2x² + 1). The arbitrary constant C is determined by substituting the initial values, yielding a specific solution.","answer_reasoning":"Example 6 in Section 9.4.1 follows this exact process. The source states: 'Integrating both sides of equation (1), we get... y = 1/(2x² - C). Substituting y=1 and x=0, we get C = -1. Then the particular solution is y = 1/(2x² + 1).'"}
{"question":"Why is the separation of variables method applicable only when the differential equation can be expressed as dy/dx = g(x)h(y), and what mathematical principle supports this approach?","answer":"The method is applicable because the equation's separable form allows rearrangement into functions of x and y on separate sides. This relies on the principle of integration for separable equations, where the equation can be split into two integrals (one in x, one in y), each solvable by standard integration techniques. The validity stems from the algebraic manipulation being permissible as long as h(y) ≠ 0.","answer_reasoning":"Section 9.4.1 states: 'If h(y) ≠ 0, separating the variables, (2) can be rewritten as (1/h(y)) dy = g(x) dx.

{"question":"How can one verify that a given function is a solution to a variable separable differential equation, as demonstrated in the source material?","answer":"To verify, substitute the function and its derivative into the differential equation. If the left-hand side equals the right-hand side for all x in the domain, the function is a solution. For example, substituting y = e^(-3x) into d²y/dx² + dy/dx - 6y = 0 (Example 2) confirms LHS = 0 = RHS.","answer_reasoning":"The source's Example 2 and 3 explicitly verify solutions by substitution. Example 2 states: 'Substituting the values of d²y/dx², dy/dx and y... L.H.S. = 0 = R.H.S.' This method is standard for verifying solutions."}
{"question":"Explain the mathematical condition that must be satisfied for a differential equation to be classified as 'variable separable,' and why this condition is essential for the solution method.","answer":"A differential equation is classified as variable separable if it can be expressed in the form dy/dx = g(x)h(y), where g(x) is a function of x alone and h(y) is a function of y alone. This condition is essential because it allows the equation to be rearranged as (1/h(y)) dy = g(x) dx, enabling separation of variables so that integration can be performed on both sides independently to find the solution.","answer_reasoning":"This is correct because the source material explicitly defines variable separable differential equations as those where F(x,y) = g(x)h(y) (Section 9.4.1). The separation process requires h(y) ≠ 0 to avoid division by zero, which is why the condition is essential for the method to work."}
{"question":"Describe the step-by-step process for solving a variable separable differential equation, including the role of the arbitrary constant in the general solution.","answer":"The solution process begins by separating all y terms (including dy) to one side and all x terms (including dx) to the other side. For dy/dx = g(x)h(y), this becomes (1/h(y)) dy = g(x) dx. Next, both sides are integrated to get ∫(1/h(y)) dy = ∫g(x) dx, resulting in H(y) = G(x) + C, where H(y) and G(x) are antiderivatives. The constant C represents the family of all possible solutions (general solution), and a particular solution is obtained by determining C using an initial condition.","answer_reasoning":"This accurately reflects the method described in Section 9.4.1. The source states: 'Integrating both sides of (3), we get ∫(1/h(y)) dy = ∫g(x) dx' and identifies the constant C as part of the general solution, with particular solutions requiring specific values for C."}
{"question":"Why must the condition h(y) ≠ 0 be explicitly stated when separating variables in a differential equation, and what mathematical consequence would occur if this condition were violated?","answer":"The condition h(y) ≠ 0 is necessary because if h(y) = 0, the equation would involve division by zero when rearranging to separate variables. If h(y) = 0, the differential equation would have constant solutions y = k where h(k) = 0, which would not be included in the general solution obtained by separation. These constant solutions must be verified separately as they may represent singular solutions not covered by the general solution with arbitrary constant C.","answer_reasoning":"The source explicitly states 'If h(y) ≠ 0, separating the variables...' (Section 9.4.1), implying that h(y) = 0 would require special handling. The condition ensures the algebraic manipulation is valid, and constant solutions must be checked separately as shown in Example 4's note about y ≠ 2."}
{"question":"Compare and contrast the general solution and particular solution of a variable separable differential equation, explaining how initial conditions are used to transition from one to the other.","answer":"The general solution of a variable separable differential equation contains an arbitrary constant C and represents the entire family of solutions that satisfy the differential equation. The particular solution is a specific member of this family obtained by assigning a value to C based on an initial condition.

The solution free from arbitrary constants... is called a particular solution.' Example 6 demonstrates this process with the condition y=1 when x=0 to find C=-1."}
{"question":"Provide a real-world application example of a variable separable differential equation, explaining how the physical situation is modeled mathematically and how the solution is interpreted in context.","answer":"An example is continuous compound interest in banking. The physical situation is that principal increases at a rate proportional to the current principal. This is modeled as dP/dt = (r/100)P, where P is principal, t is time, and r is the annual interest rate. This equation is variable separable as dP/P = (r/100)dt. Integrating gives ln|P| = (r/100)t + C, so P = Ce^(rt/100). With initial condition P=1000 when t=0, C=1000, so P=1000e^(rt/100). The solution shows exponential growth, and for doubling time, solving 2000=1000e^(rt/100) gives t= (100/r)ln2.","answer_reasoning":"This is directly modeled after Example 9 in Section 9.4.1, which solves the exact problem: 'In a bank, principal increases continuously at the rate of 5% per year.

{"question":"Explain the mathematical process for solving a first-order differential equation that is variable separable, including the key conditions required for the method to be applicable.","answer":"A differential equation is variable separable if it can be expressed as dy/dx = g(x)h(y), where g(x) is a function of x only and h(y) is a function of y only. The method requires that h(y) ≠ 0 to avoid division by zero during separation. The equation is rearranged to (1/h(y)) dy = g(x) dx, then both sides are integrated: ∫(1/h(y)) dy = ∫g(x) dx + C. This yields the general solution. For example, in the source material (Example 5), the equation dy/dx = (1 + y²)/(1 + x²) is solved by separating variables to ∫dy/(1 + y²) = ∫dx/(1 + x²), resulting in tan⁻¹y = tan⁻¹x + C.","answer_reasoning":"This answer correctly identifies the conditions (h(y) ≠ 0) and steps (separation, integration) as described in section 9.4.1 of the source material.

{"question":"Why must the condition h(y) ≠ 0 be explicitly stated when separating variables in a differential equation of the form dy/dx = g(x)h(y)? Provide a mathematical justification and an example from the source material.","answer":"The condition h(y) ≠ 0 is necessary because separating variables involves dividing by h(y), which is undefined if h(y) = 0. If h(y) = 0, the equation reduces to dy/dx = 0, implying y is constant (a valid solution not captured by the general solution derived from separation). For example, in Example 6, the equation dy/dx = -4xy² has h(y) = y². The constant solution y = 0 must be verified separately, as it is not included in the general solution y = 1/(2x² - C).","answer_reasoning":"The source material explicitly states 'If h(y) ≠ 0, separating the variables...' (section 9.4.1). Example 6 demonstrates the constant solution y = 0 as a valid solution that requires separate verification, confirming the necessity of the h(y) ≠ 0 condition."}
{"question":"Provide a differential equation that is variable separable but requires algebraic manipulation to separate the variables. Explain the steps needed to separate the variables and solve the equation.","answer":"Consider the differential equation sec²x tan y dx + sec²y tan x dy = 0 (Exercise 9.3, problem 4). To separate variables, rearrange terms to sec²y tan y dy = -sec²x tan x dx. This requires dividing both sides by cos²x cos²y to isolate functions of y and x. Integrating both sides: ∫(sin y / cos³y) dy = -∫(sin x / cos³x) dx. Using substitution u = cos y (du = -sin y dy), the left integral becomes ∫-du/u³ = 1/(2u²) + C = 1/(2cos²y) + C. Similarly for the right side, the solution is 1/(2cos²y) = 1/(2cos²x) + C, or sec²y = sec²x + 2C.","answer_reasoning":"The source material lists this equation as Exercise 9.3, problem 4, confirming it as a variable separable equation requiring algebraic manipulation.

{"question":"How does the general solution of a variable separable differential equation differ from its particular solution? Use an example from the source material to illustrate this difference.","answer":"The general solution contains an arbitrary constant (e.g., C) representing a family of solutions. A particular solution is derived by applying specific initial conditions to determine the constant's value. For example, in Example 6, the general solution of dy/dx = -4xy² is y = 1/(2x² - C). Given the initial condition y = 1 when x = 0, substituting yields 1 = 1/(0 - C) ⇒ C = -1. Thus, the particular solution is y = 1/(2x² + 1), which satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition.","answer_reasoning":"The source material explicitly shows this distinction in Example 6, where the general solution (y = 1/(2x² - C)) is transformed into a particular solution using the initial condition. The answer accurately reflects this process as documented."}
{"question":"Describe a method to verify that a given function is a solution to a variable separable differential equation. How does this process differ from verifying solutions for non-separable equations?","answer":"Verification involves substituting the function and its derivative into the differential equation to confirm both sides are equal. For variable separable equations, this is straightforward due to the separated form. For example, in Example 5, substituting y = tan⁻¹x + C into dy/dx = (1 + y²)/(1 + x²) confirms the solution. For non-separable equations (e.g., homogeneous or linear), verification may require additional algebraic steps to simplify both sides. However, the core method (substitution) remains consistent across all differential equation types.","answer_reasoning":"The source material uses verification in Examples 2 and 5 (Example 5 is variable separable, Example 2 is not). The answer correctly states that verification relies on substitution, with variable separable equations being simpler to verify due to their separated form, as demonstrated in the examples."}
{"question":"What are the necessary conditions for a first-order differential equation to be classified as variable separable? How can you verify if a given differential equation meets these conditions?","answer":"A first-order differential equation is classified as variable separable if it can be expressed in the form dy/dx = F(x,y) where F(x,y) can be written as a product g(x)h(y), with g(x) being a function of x alone and h(y) being a function of y alone.

It also mentions that C is 'the arbitrary constant' in the solution."}
{"question":"What are the limitations of the variable separable method for solving differential equations? How can you identify when this method will not work?","answer":"The variable separable method has limitations when the differential equation cannot be expressed in the form where F(x,y) = g(x)h(y). This happens when F(x,y) cannot be factored into a product of a function of x alone and a function of y alone. For example, equations like dy/dx = x + y or dy/dx = sin(x + y) cannot be separated. The method also requires that h(y) ≠ 0. To identify when the method will not work, check if F(x,y) can be factored as g(x)h(y) and if h(y) ≠ 0.

The solution process follows the same steps as described in the answer, with the general solution P = Ce^(t/20) as shown in the example."}
{"question":"Explain the necessary condition for a first-order differential equation to be classified as variable separable, and justify why this condition enables the solution process.","answer":"A first-order differential equation is classified as variable separable if its right-hand side F(x,y) can be expressed as a product of a function of x (g(x)) and a function of y (h(y)), i.e., F(x,y) = g(x)h(y). This condition enables the solution process because it allows the equation to be rearranged into the form (1/h(y))dy = g(x)dx, where all y terms are with dy and all x terms are with dx. This separation of variables makes it possible to integrate both sides independently, resulting in a solution through straightforward integration.","answer_reasoning":"The source material explicitly states: 'If F(x, y) can be expressed as a product g(x) h(y), where, g(x) is a function of x and h(y) is a function of y, then the differential equation (1) is said to be of variable separable type.' It further explains that when h(y) ≠ 0, the equation can be rewritten as (1/h(y))dy = g(x)dx, which can then be integrated to find the solution. This separation is the fundamental requirement that makes the variable separable method applicable."}
{"question":"Describe the step-by-step process for solving a variable separable differential equation, and explain the mathematical justification for each step.","answer":"The solution process for a variable separable differential equation involves: (1) Verifying F(x,y) can be expressed as g(x)h(y), (2) Separating variables by dividing both sides by h(y) (assuming h(y) ≠ 0) to get (1/h(y))dy = g(x)dx, (3) Integrating both sides to obtain ∫(1/h(y))dy = ∫g(x)dx, and (4) Solving for y to get the general solution. Each step is mathematically justified: Step 1 ensures the equation is separable; Step 2 is valid algebraic manipulation; Step 3 uses the fundamental theorem of calculus to find antiderivatives; and Step 4 combines the results to express the solution explicitly or implicitly.","answer_reasoning":"The source material states: 'If h(y) ≠ 0, separating the variables, (2) can be rewritten as (1/h(y))dy = g(x)dx.

The mathematical justification for each step is consistent with standard calculus principles for solving separable equations."}
{"question":"Explain the difference between the general solution and particular solution of a variable separable differential equation, and describe how initial conditions affect the transition between these solutions.","answer":"The general solution of a variable separable differential equation contains an arbitrary constant (C) and represents a family of curves that satisfy the differential equation. It is obtained by integrating both sides of the separated equation. A particular solution is derived from the general solution by determining the specific value of C using an initial condition (e.g., y = y0 when x = x0). Initial conditions provide specific points through which the solution curve must pass, allowing the arbitrary constant to be replaced with a numerical value, thus narrowing the infinite family of solutions to a single specific solution.","answer_reasoning":"The source material explicitly defines these concepts: 'The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution (primitive) of the differential equation. The solution free from arbitrary constants i.e., the solution obtained from the general solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular solution of the differential equation.' Examples 6 and 7 demonstrate this transition from general to particular solution using initial conditions (y=1 when x=0 in Example 6)."}
{"question":"In Example 4 from the source material, the solution excludes y=2. Explain why this exclusion is mathematically necessary and how it affects the domain of the solution.","answer":"The exclusion of y=2 in Example 4 is mathematically necessary because the original differential equation dy/dx = (x+1)/(2-y) has a denominator of (2-y), which becomes zero when y=2. Division by zero is undefined in mathematics, so the differential equation itself is not defined at y=2. This exclusion affects the domain of the solution by restricting the solution curve to regions where y ≠ 2, ensuring the solution remains valid and continuous. The solution curve cannot cross the line y=2, as it would make the differential equation undefined at that point.","answer_reasoning":"The source material explicitly states: 'dy/dx = (x+1)/(2-y), (y ≠ 2)' in Example 4. It further explains that the equation is written with the condition y ≠ 2, indicating this restriction is necessary for the equation to be defined. Mathematically, a differential equation must be defined at every point in its solution domain, so the exclusion of y=2 is essential for the solution to be valid."}
{"question":"Discuss the mathematical implications when g(y) = 0 in a variable separable differential equation dy/dx = g(x)h(y), and explain why constant solutions must be considered separately.","answer":"When g(y) = 0 (i.e., h(y) = 0 for some values of y), the variable separable method may miss constant solutions. Specifically, if h(y) = 0 for some y = k, then y = k is a constant solution to the differential equation because dy/dx = 0 when y = k. However, the variable separable method involves dividing by h(y), which would be undefined when h(y) = 0. Therefore, constant solutions where h(y) = 0 must be checked separately and added to the general solution if they satisfy the differential equation, as they cannot be obtained through the standard separation process.","answer_reasoning":"The source material states: 'If h(y) ≠ 0, separating the variables, (2) can be rewritten as (1/h(y))dy = g(x)dx.' This implies that h(y) = 0 must be handled separately. The mathematical principle is that division by zero is undefined, so the separation method cannot yield solutions where h(y) = 0. These constant solutions must be verified independently by substitution into the original differential equation, as demonstrated in the conceptual understanding of differential equation solution methods."}

A non-homogeneous differential equation does not satisfy this property. For example, dy/dx = (x + 2y)/(x - y) is homogeneous because F(λx,λy) = (λx + 2λy)/(λx - λy) = (x + 2y)/(x - y) = F(x,y). In contrast, dy/dx = x^2 + y^2 is non-homogeneous because F(λx,λy) = λ^2(x^2 + y^2) ≠ F(x,y), and it's actually homogeneous of degree 2, not 0.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct based on the source material which defines homogeneous functions and provides examples.

The example given in the answer matches the source material's examples of homogeneous differential equations."}
{"question":"Explain why the substitution y = vx is particularly effective for solving homogeneous differential equations, and what mathematical insight makes this substitution work.","answer":"The substitution y = vx is effective because it exploits the fundamental property of homogeneous functions of degree zero: they depend only on the ratio y/x. By setting v = y/x (or y = vx), we transform the equation into one where the variables can be separated. This works because for a homogeneous function of degree zero, F(x,y) = g(y/x) = g(v), so the differential equation becomes dy/dx = g(v), which with the substitution dy/dx = v + x(dv/dx) leads to an equation that can be separated into functions of v and x alone.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct based on the source material which states: 'A differential equation of the form dy/dx = F(x,y) is said to be homogenous if F(x,y) is a homogenous function of degree zero.'

{"question":"Describe how you would solve the homogeneous differential equation dy/dx = (x + 2y)/(x - y) and find the particular solution passing through the point (1,1).","answer":"First, verify the equation is homogeneous by checking F(λx,λy) = F(x,y). Here F(x,y) = (x+2y)/(x-y), so F(λx,λy) = (λx+2λy)/(λx-λy) = (x+2y)/(x-y) = F(x,y), confirming it's homogeneous. Next, use substitution y = vx, so dy/dx = v + x(dv/dx). Substitute into the equation: v + x(dv/dx) = (1 + 2v)/(1 - v). Rearrange to separate variables: x(dv/dx) = (1+2v)/(1-v) - v = (v^2 + v + 1)/(1 - v). Separate: (v-1)/(v^2+v+1) dv = -dx/x. Integrate both sides: (1/2)ln|v^2+v+1| - √3 tan^-1((2v+1)/√3) = -ln|x| + C. Replace v with y/x and solve for C using the point (1,1): (1/2)ln|1+1+1| - √3 tan^-1(3/√3) = -ln|1| + C → (1/2)ln3 - √3 tan^-1(√3) = C → C = (1/2)ln3 - √3(π/3). The particular solution is then (1/2)ln|y^2/x^2 + y/x + 1| - √3 tan^-1((2y/x + 1)/√3) = -ln|x| + (1/2)ln3 - √3(π/3).","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct based on the source material, which provides the exact same method for solving homogeneous differential equations in Example 10.

{"question":"How would you determine if the differential equation (x^2 + y^2)dx = xydy is homogeneous, and what would be the general solution using the substitution method?","answer":"To determine if (x^2 + y^2)dx = xydy is homogeneous, we rewrite it as dy/dx = (x^2 + y^2)/xy. Then we check F(x,y) = (x^2 + y^2)/xy for homogeneity: F(λx, λy) = (λ^2x^2 + λ^2y^2)/(λx * λy) = λ^2(x^2 + y^2)/λ^2xy = (x^2 + y^2)/xy = F(x,y), confirming it's homogeneous of degree zero. To solve it, we use y = vx, so dy/dx = v + x dv/dx. Substituting gives v + x dv/dx = (x^2 + v^2x^2)/(x * vx) = (1 + v^2)/v. Rearranging: x dv/dx = (1 + v^2)/v - v = 1/v. Separating variables: v dv = dx/x. Integrating: (1/2)v^2 = log|x| + C.

The algebraic steps match the source material's approach to transforming and solving homogeneous differential equations."}
{"question":"What is the significance of the degree of homogeneity in differential equations, and why must it be zero for a differential equation to be classified as homogeneous?","answer":"The degree of homogeneity determines how a function scales when its variables are scaled by a constant. For a differential equation to be classified as homogeneous, F(x,y) must be a homogeneous function of degree zero. This means F(λx, λy) = F(x,y) for all λ ≠ 0, which implies that F(x,y) depends only on the ratio y/x. This property is essential because it allows the substitution y = vx to transform the equation into a separable form.

When we substitute y = vx, we have y/x = v, so F(x,y) = g(v). This transforms the differential equation dy/dx = F(x,y) into dy/dx = g(v), and since y = vx, we have dy/dx = v + x dv/dx.

This can be rewritten as dy/dx = (x + 2y)/(x - y). Here, F(x,y) = (x + 2y)/(x - y) is homogeneous of degree 0 because F(λx, λy) = (λx + 2λy)/(λx - λy) = (x + 2y)/(x - y) = F(x,y).

This distinguishes them from other types like separable equations (where F(x,y) = g(x)h(y)), linear equations (where F(x,y) = P(x) + Q(x)y), or exact equations. The key distinguishing feature is the homogeneity property: F(λx, λy) = F(x,y) for all nonzero λ.

{"question":"Explain the difference between a homogeneous and a non-homogeneous differential equation with specific examples of each.","answer":"A homogeneous differential equation is one where F(x,y) in dy/dx = F(x,y) is homogeneous of degree zero (F(λx, λy) = F(x,y)). A non-homogeneous differential equation is one where F(x,y) is not homogeneous of degree zero, or where the equation contains additional non-homogeneous terms. Example of homogeneous: dy/dx = (x + 2y)/(x - y) (as shown in Example 10), where F(x,y) = (x + 2y)/(x - y) satisfies F(λx, λy) = F(x,y). Example of non-homogeneous: dy/dx = x + y + 1, where F(x,y) = x + y + 1 does not satisfy F(λx, λy) = λ^n F(x,y) for any n, because of the constant term +1.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct based on the source material. The source defines homogeneous differential equations as those where F(x,y) is homogeneous of degree zero. It provides Example 10 as a homogeneous differential equation, where F(λx, λy) = λ^0 F(x,y). The example of a non-homogeneous equation is consistent with the definition since the constant term breaks the homogeneity property (F(λx, λy) = λx + λy + 1 ≠ λ^n(x + y + 1) for any n)."}
{"question":"Describe the complete process for solving a homogeneous differential equation using the substitution method, including verification of the solution.","answer":"The complete process for solving a homogeneous differential equation dy/dx = g(y/x) is: (1) Use substitution y = vx (so dy/dx = v + x(dv/dx)), (2) Substitute into equation to get v + x(dv/dx) = g(v), (3) Rearrange to separate variables: x(dv/dx) = g(v) - v, (4) Separate variables: dv/(g(v) - v) = dx/x, (5) Integrate both sides: ∫dv/(g(v) - v) = ∫dx/x, (6) Replace v with y/x to get general solution. To verify the solution, substitute the solution and its derivative back into the original differential equation; if both sides are equal, the solution is correct.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct based on the source material, which details the entire process in Example 10.

The source then integrates both sides to find the general solution. Verification is a standard step in solving differential equations, as shown in Example 2 where the solution is verified by substitution."}
{"question":"What is the precise mathematical definition of a homogeneous differential equation of the first order?","answer":"A differential equation of the form dy/dx = F(x,y) is said to be homogeneous if F(x,y) is a homogeneous function of degree zero. This means that for any nonzero constant λ, F(λx, λy) = F(x,y). Equivalently, F(x,y) can be expressed as a function of the ratio y/x only, i.e., F(x,y) = g(y/x) for some function g.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct based on the source material. The source explicitly states: 'A differential equation of the form dy/dx = F(x,y) is said to be homogenous if F(x,y) is a homogenous function of degree zero.' It also states: 'A function F(x,y) is said to be homogeneous function of degree n if F(λx, λy) = λ^n F(x,y) for any nonzero constant λ.' For the differential equation to be homogeneous, n must be 0, so F(λx, λy) = F(x,y). The source further explains that homogeneous functions of degree zero can be expressed as functions of y/x."}
{"question":"Why is the substitution y = vx particularly effective for solving homogeneous differential equations?","answer":"The substitution y = vx is effective because it transforms a homogeneous differential equation into a separable one. Since F(x,y) is homogeneous of degree zero, it can be expressed as a function of the ratio y/x only. The substitution y = vx makes y/x = v, so F(x,y) = g(v), a function of a single variable v. This allows the differential equation to be rewritten as v + x dv/dx = g(v), which can be rearranged to separate the variables as dv/(g(v)-v) = dx/x. Once separated, the equation can be integrated directly.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct based on the source material. The source states: 'To solve a homogeneous differential equation of the type dy/dx = F(x,y) = g(y/x), We make the substitution y = vx.' It then shows the process: 'Differentiating equation (2) with respect to x, we get dy/dx = v + x dv/dx.' Substituting into the equation gives 'v + x dv/dx = g(v)', which can be rearranged to 'x dv/dx = g(v) - v' and then separated as 'dv/(g(v)-v) = dx/x'. This separation is what allows the equation to be integrated."}
{"question":"How does the property of homogeneity (F(λx, λy) = λ^n F(x,y)) determine whether a differential equation is homogeneous?","answer":"A differential equation dy/dx = F(x,y) is homogeneous if and only if F(x,y) is homogeneous of degree zero (n = 0). If F(x,y) is homogeneous of degree n ≠ 0, then the differential equation is not homogeneous. For a homogeneous differential equation, F(λx, λy) = λ^0 F(x,y) = F(x,y), which means F(x,y) depends only on the ratio y/x. This property is crucial because it allows the substitution y = vx to transform the equation into a separable form.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct based on the source material. The source defines homogeneous functions: 'A function F(x,y) is said to be homogeneous function of degree n if F(λx, λy) = λ^n F(x,y) for any nonzero constant λ.' It then states: 'A differential equation of the form dy/dx = F(x,y) is said to be homogenous if F(x,y) is a homogenous function of degree zero.' The source also explains that homogeneous functions of degree zero can be written as F(x,y) = g(y/x), which is essential for the substitution method to work."}
{"question":"How would you verify whether a given differential equation dy/dx = F(x,y) is homogeneous?","answer":"To verify if a differential equation dy/dx = F(x,y) is homogeneous, I would check if F(λx, λy) = F(x,y) for any nonzero constant λ. If this identity holds, then F(x,y) is homogeneous of degree zero, and the differential equation is homogeneous. I would also check if F(x,y) can be expressed as a function of y/x only (e.g., F(x,y) = g(y/x)), which is equivalent to F(λx, λy) = F(x,y). If F(λx, λy) = λ^n F(x,y) with n ≠ 0, then the equation is not homogeneous.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct based on the source material.

Verify F(x,y) is homogeneous of degree zero (F(λx, λy) = F(x,y)). 2. Make the substitution y = vx, so dy/dx = v + x dv/dx. 3. Substitute y = vx and dy/dx = v + x dv/dx into the equation to get v + x dv/dx = F(x, vx). 4. Since F is homogeneous of degree zero, F(x, vx) = g(v) for some function g. 5. Rearrange to separate variables: x dv/dx = g(v) - v, so dv/(g(v)-v) = dx/x. 6. Integrate both sides: ∫ dv/(g(v)-v) = ∫ dx/x. 7. Solve the integrals to find v as a function of x. 8.

It explains how the equation is rearranged to 'x dv/dx = g(v) - v' and separated as 'dv/(g(v)-v) = dx/x'. The source also provides examples (Examples 10, 11, and 12) that follow this exact process."}
{"question":"Explain the role of the integrating factor in solving first-order linear differential equations and why it is effective.","answer":"The integrating factor (I.F.) is a function multiplied by both sides of a first-order linear differential equation to transform the left-hand side into the derivative of a product. For an equation in the standard form dy/dx + P(x)y = Q(x), the I.F. is calculated as e^∫P(x) dx. Multiplying through by this factor allows the left-hand side to be expressed as d/dx(y * I.F.), which can then be integrated directly to solve for y. This method works because the integrating factor is specifically designed to make the left-hand side a perfect derivative, enabling straightforward integration.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it accurately describes the integrating factor's purpose as derived from the source material.

Examples 14-17 demonstrate this process explicitly."}
{"question":"Why is it necessary to express a linear differential equation in the standard form dy/dx + P(x)y = Q(x) before applying the integrating factor method?","answer":"The standard form is required because the integrating factor is derived specifically for equations where the coefficient of y (P(x)) is a function of x only, and the equation is linear in y and its derivative. If the equation is not in this form, the calculation of the integrating factor (e^∫P(x) dx) will be incorrect, and the left-hand side cannot be transformed into a derivative of a product. The source explicitly defines linear differential equations as those where P and Q are functions of x only, making standard form essential for applying the integrating factor method.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because the source defines linear differential equations as dy/dx + P y = Q where P and Q are functions of x only. The integrating factor method relies on this specific structure; if P depends on y or the equation isn't in standard form, the method fails. The source states this condition clearly in section 9.4.3."}
{"question":"Explain why the coefficients P and Q in a first-order linear differential equation must be functions of x only (not y), and what happens if this condition is not met.","answer":"The coefficients P and Q must be functions of x only because the linearity of the differential equation requires that it be linear in y and its derivative. If P or Q depends on y, the equation becomes nonlinear, and the integrating factor method (which depends on P being a function of x only) cannot be applied. Nonlinear equations require different solution techniques, such as separation of variables or substitution methods for homogeneous equations, as discussed in the source material. The linearity condition ensures that the integrating factor correctly transforms the equation into a solvable derivative form.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct as it reflects the source's definition of linear differential equations in section 9.4.3. The source specifies that P and Q must be constants or functions of x only.

{"question":"How does the method for solving a first-order linear differential equation change when the equation is expressed in terms of dx/dy instead of dy/dx, and what is the corresponding integrating factor?","answer":"When the equation is in the form dx/dy + P1(y)x = Q1(y), where P1 and Q1 are functions of y only, the integrating factor is calculated as e^∫P1(y) dy. The solution process remains analogous to the dy/dx case: multiply both sides by the I.F., recognize the left-hand side as d/dy(x * I.F.), integrate with respect to y, and solve for x. The source explicitly states that for equations of the form dx/dy + P1 x = Q1, the I.F. = e^∫P1 dy, and the solution follows the same pattern as for dy/dx equations.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because the source material (section 9.4.3) provides the alternative form dx/dy + P1 x = Q1 and states that I.F. = e^∫P1 dy.

This is because multiplying both sides by $ e^{\\int P(x) dx} $ ensures the left-hand side matches the product rule expansion, enabling direct integration to solve for $ y $. As stated in the source, 'Multiply both sides of the equation by a function of $ x $ say $ g(x) $ to get $ g(x) \\frac{dy}{dx} + P \\cdot g(x) y = Q \\cdot g(x) $.

{"question":"Why does the general solution of a first-order linear differential equation contain exactly one arbitrary constant? How does this relate to the order of the differential equation?","answer":"The general solution of a first-order linear differential equation contains exactly one arbitrary constant because the order of the differential equation is 1, and the number of arbitrary constants in the general solution equals the order. This is consistent with the source's definition: 'The solution which contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the differential equation is called a general solution.'

Why is this factor important?","answer":"To find the integrating factor for a first-order linear differential equation of the form dy/dx + Py = Q, we calculate I.F. = e^∫P dx. This factor is important because when we multiply the entire differential equation by the integrating factor, the left-hand side becomes the derivative of the product of y and the integrating factor (i.e., d/dx(y·I.F.)). This transformation allows us to integrate both sides directly to find the solution, as the left-hand side becomes a single derivative that can be easily integrated.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct based on the source material, which states: 'Multiply both sides of the equation by a function of x say g(x) to get g(x) dy/dx + P·(g(x))y = Q·g(x).

{"question":"Explain the difference between the general solution and particular solution of a linear differential equation. How do we obtain a particular solution from the general solution?","answer":"The general solution of a linear differential equation contains arbitrary constants (one for each order of the equation) and represents the entire family of solutions. A particular solution is obtained from the general solution by assigning specific values to these arbitrary constants, typically based on initial or boundary conditions. For a first-order linear differential equation, the general solution will contain one arbitrary constant, and we can find a particular solution by substituting the given condition (e.g., y = y0 when x = x0) to solve for that constant.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is factually correct based on the source material, which states: 'The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution (primitive) of the differential equation.

The integrating factor (I.F.) is calculated as e^∫P dx = e^∫cot x dx = e^log sin x = sin x. Multiplying both sides of the equation by the I.F., we get sin x dy/dx + y cos x = (2x + x^2 cot x) sin x, which simplifies to d/dx(y sin x) = 2x sin x + x^2 cos x. Integrating both sides, we find y sin x = ∫(2x sin x + x^2 cos x) dx + C. The integral simplifies to x^2 sin x + C, so the general solution is y = x^2 + C/sin x.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct based on the source material, which provides a similar example in Example 17: 'The given equation is a linear differential equation of the type dy/dx + Py = Q, where P = cot x and Q = 2x + x^2 cot x.

{"question":"Explain the significance of the integrating factor in solving linear differential equations. How does it transform the differential equation into a form that can be easily integrated?","answer":"The integrating factor is significant because it transforms the left-hand side of the linear differential equation into the derivative of a product. Specifically, for a first-order linear differential equation dy/dx + Py = Q, the integrating factor I.F. = e^∫P dx makes the equation d/dx(y·I.F.) = Q·I.F. This transformed equation can then be directly integrated with respect to x to find the solution. The integrating factor essentially 'combines' the left-hand side into a single derivative, making integration straightforward.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct based on the source material, which states: 'Multiply both sides of the equation by a function of x say g(x) to get g(x) dy/dx + P·(g(x))y = Q·g(x).

{"question":"How do differential equations model bacterial growth, and what assumptions are made in the model that lead to the exponential growth solution?","answer":"Differential equations model bacterial growth by assuming the rate of growth is proportional to the current population. This leads to the differential equation dN/dt = kN, where N is the population size and k is the growth rate constant. The solution is N(t) = N0e^(kt), which represents exponential growth. The assumption that the growth rate is proportional to the current population is valid for short-term growth when resources are abundant. In Exercise 22, the problem states: 'The bacteria count is 1,00,000. The number is increased by 10% in 2 hours.' This can be modeled as dN/dt = kN, leading to N(t) = 100000e^(kt), and k can be found from the given information. The source explicitly states: 'the rate of growth of bacteria is proportional to the number present,' which is the key assumption for the exponential model.","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it directly relates to Exercise 22 in the source material, which asks about bacterial growth modeled by a differential equation. The source states: 'the rate of growth of bacteria is proportional to the number present.' The solution method is a standard application of separable differential equations as demonstrated in the source material."}
{"question":"Explain how differential equations are used to find the equation of a curve given the slope of the tangent at any point on the curve, and provide a specific example from the source material.","answer":"Differential equations are used to find the equation of a curve given the slope of the tangent at any point by setting up an equation where dy/dx equals the given slope function. For example, in Example 18, the problem states: 'the slope of the tangent to the curve at any point (x, y) is equal to the sum of the x coordinate and the product of the x coordinate and y coordinate of that point.' This translates to dy/dx = x + xy, which is a linear differential equation. Solving it using the integrating factor method gives y = -1 + Ce^(x^2/2), and using the initial condition (0,1) gives C = 2, so the equation is y = -1 + 2e^(x^2/2). The source explains this method in detail in Section 9.4.3, where it states: 'A differential equation of the form dy/dx + Py = Q, where P and Q are constants or functions of x only, is known as a first order linear differential equation.'","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it directly uses Example 18 from the source material. The source explicitly states: 'the slope of the tangent to the curve at any point (x, y) is equal to the sum of the x coordinate (abscissa) and the product of the x coordinate and y coordinate (ordinate) of that point,' which leads to the differential equation dy/dx = x + xy. The solution method and result are consistent with the example provided in the source material."}
{"question":"Describe how differential equations are applied in geometry to find families of curves with a given property, and explain the significance of the arbitrary constants in the general solution.","answer":"Differential equations are applied in geometry to find families of curves with a given property by setting up an equation that relates the slope of the tangent to the coordinates of the point. For example, in Example 13, the problem states: 'the slope of the tangent at any point (x, y) on it is (x^2 + y^2)/(2xy)', which leads to the differential equation dy/dx = (x^2 + y^2)/(2xy). This is a homogeneous differential equation, and solving it using the substitution y = vx gives x^2 - y^2 = Cx. The arbitrary constant C represents the family of curves with the given property. Each value of C gives a specific curve (e.g., a hyperbola), and the general solution represents all such curves. The source material explains this method in Section 9.4.2, stating: 'To solve a homogeneous differential equation of the type dy/dx = F(x,y) = g(y/x), we make the substitution y = vx.'","answer_reasoning":"This answer is correct because it directly references Example 13 from the source material, which is about finding the family of curves for which the slope of the tangent at any point is given by (x^2 + y^2)/(2xy). The solution method using substitution y = vx for homogeneous equations is explained, and the significance of the arbitrary constant in the general solution is correctly stated. The explanation matches the source material's description of the method and the role of arbitrary constants."}
