        correct_answer: "Using an integrating factor",
        correct_rationale: "The equation has coefficients tan(x) and sec(x), which are discontinuous at x = π/2 + kπ. However, the integrating factor method is applicable on intervals where these functions are continuous, making it the standard approach.",

            "Separation of variables": "Students often incorrectly attempt to separate variables when the equation contains a product of $y$ and a function of $x$ (e.g., $\\tan(x)y$), overlooking that linear ODEs require an integrating factor instead of separation.",

        correct_rationale: "The integrating factor $e^{\\int 3 \\, dx} = e^{3x}$ corresponds to a coefficient of 3 for $y$, matching the first option. Option D has a coefficient of 4, so it would require $e^{4x}$ as the integrating factor.",

            "\\frac{dy}{dx} + 7y = 3": "Mistakenly uses the constant term from the correct answer's right-hand side (7) as the coefficient of $y$, resulting in $P(x) = 7$ and integrating factor $e^{7x}$.",
